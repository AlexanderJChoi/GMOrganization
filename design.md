# Structure

## Lore
Every Entity described below has an associated Lore Page which contains all relevant information about the Entity. 

## Maps
Maps have an associated image, and contain locations of interest. Locations of interest are associated with either a 
specific coordinate on the containing map or a rectangular region; they can either contain a map or an encounter. An encounter 
has an associated image, but does not contain a map; instead, it contains Entities. 

## Interface
The interface provides methods to create new Lore Entries and Entities, methods to save and load Entities and Lore 
Entries, and can designate a root map to have automatically selected.
